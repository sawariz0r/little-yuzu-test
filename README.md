# Capstone React Native app for Coursera Certificate

It seems the userbase might find the use of Typescript daunting, but I tried to keep it to an absolute minimum and still include it to keep me sane :)

And there's things I could've moved out to separate components, the state using sqlite and asyncstorage isn't perfect but it works. In this case I would probably have pulled out Zustand and used AsyncStorage to persist that data, but decided against this in the end.

I also ended up using Expo Router instead of React Navigation.
